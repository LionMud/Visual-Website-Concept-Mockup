## üìÑ How to Extract All Content from Your PDF (Automatic Workflow)

1. **Install Poppler for Windows:**
   - Download from: https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases/
   - Unzip to a folder (e.g., `C:\poppler\`).
   - Add `C:\poppler\Library\bin` to your system PATH.

2. **Place your PDF in the project root.**
   - Example: `Pizza Mafia Cura√ßao ‚Äì Deep Research Report.pdf`

3. **Run the extraction script:**
   - Open a PowerShell terminal in your project folder.
   - Run:
     ```pwsh
     ./extract_pdf_content.ps1
     ```
   - This will create:
     - `src/content/research-report.txt` (all text from the PDF)
     - Images in `public/images/` (named `pizzamafia_img-000.png`, etc.)

4. **Integrate into your site:**
   - Copy/paste each concept, section, or source from `research-report.txt` into the appropriate JSON file in `src/content/sections/` (e.g., `about.json`).
   - Reference the extracted image filenames in the `images` array in your JSON files.
   - Your React site will update automatically‚Äîno code changes needed.

5. **Repeat for any new PDF!**

## üîë Where to Put API Keys and Secrets

- Use the `.env.local` file in your project root for all API keys and secrets.
- Example:
  ```env
  OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
  GOOGLE_API_KEY=...
  NETLIFY_FUNCTION_SECRET=...
  ```
- **Never commit `.env.local` to GitHub!** (Add it to your `.gitignore` if not already.)
- In React/Next.js, use `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_...` for variables needed in the browser, and `process.env.XXX` for server-only secrets (like in Netlify Functions).
- In Netlify Functions, access secrets with `process.env.YOUR_KEY`.

- For any feature or fix, describe what you want and it will be added for you.
